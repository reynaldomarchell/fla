E-Learning Application Management System

You are tasked with building an application for managing an e-learning system for the company "LearnTech". The application will manage student data registered on the platform. You must use the State Pattern and Iterator Pattern based on the following criteria:

When the program starts, display a menu for the user. The menu should have the following options:
1. Register New Student
2. View Students
3. Exit

If the user selects the Register New Student option:
Prompt the user to input the following details:
   Student Name: The name cannot be empty.
   Student Age: The age must be at least 18 years.
   Selected Course: The user must input either "Programming" or "Design" (case-sensitive).

Once all data is validated, the system should:
Generate a unique Student ID consisting of 6 random alphanumeric characters.
Set the initial state based on the selected course:
   Programming: The initial state is Basic Programming.
   Design: The initial state is Basic Design.
Display a success message and add the student data to the database.

If the user selects the View Students option, perform the following steps:
Check if the student database is empty:
   If empty, display the message "No students registered.".
   If the database is not empty:

Iterate through the list of students using the Iterator Pattern.
Display the following details for each student:
   Student ID
   Student Name
   Age
   Selected Course
   Current Progress State

Prompt the user to input an action:
Input "N": Advance the student's progress to the next state.
Input "Q": Exit viewing and return to the menu.

Each course has its own progress phases, implemented using the State Pattern:

Programming Course Phases
   Basic Programming
   Advanced Programming
   Project Submission
   Completed

Design Course Phases
   Basic Design
   Advanced Design
   Portfolio Submission
